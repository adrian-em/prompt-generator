# Prompt Generator

A Web Application to easily generate a prompt for your console.

This is my first AngularJS application, so have that in mind.
I would be very interested in any improvement or best practice that could lead
to a better app.

If you have any suggestion, improvement or issue, do not doubt and open an
issue. I will try to do my best to solve it.

## Motivation

The main purpose is to learn something about this framework, but also I found
this application to be very useful for those who like to customize their prompt.

### Server-side
This project uses ExpressJS over NodeJS to serve the web application.
Then, I configured all to be behind a nginx as reverse-proxy, because it was easier
for me (I have other projects running behind nginx)
